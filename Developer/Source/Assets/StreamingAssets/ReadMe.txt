Thanks for downloading UnityMusicPlayer! It's currently in development, so please expect things to change in later releases. In version 0.9 we've added/changed the following:

• More music file compatibility ( .ogg will be supported )
• Major optimizations
• Web and disk streaming implemented ( .wav only, right now )
• Framework for musicMaker ( music creation tool )
• Improvements to downloaded audio handling ( encryption enabled )
• Support for pending song releases

In the next major update (1.0) we plan on adding/changing the following:

• Functional ( at least, at some level ) musicMaker
• First stage of audio conversions ( AIF to WAV )
• New audio visualizer
